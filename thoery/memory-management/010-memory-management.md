In computer systems, understanding how memory is addressed is crucial for efficient program execution and system security. The three primary types of memory addresses are:([Scaler][1])

### üß† Logical Address (also known as Virtual Address)

* **Definition**: A logical address is generated by the CPU during program execution. It represents the address used by a program to access memory.([GeeksforGeeks][2])

* **Characteristics**:

  * It is part of the process's address space and is used by the program to access memory.
  * The logical address is translated to a physical address by the Memory Management Unit (MMU) before the actual memory access occurs.([Engineering LibreTexts][3])

* **Example**: When a program accesses a variable, it uses a logical address, which the system translates to the corresponding physical address in RAM.([GeeksforGeeks][2])

---

### üíæ Physical Address

* **Definition**: The physical address refers to an actual location in the computer's main memory (RAM). It is the address that the memory unit uses to access data.

* **Characteristics**:

  * It is not directly accessible by user-level programs.
  * The operating system and MMU handle the translation from logical to physical addresses.([GeeksforGeeks][2])

* **Example**: The physical address is the real location in RAM where the data resides.([GeeksforGeeks][2])

### üåê Virtual Address

* **Definition**: A virtual address is an abstraction that allows programs to use memory as if they have contiguous and private address spaces, even though the physical memory might be fragmented.

* **Characteristics**:

  * It enables processes to use more memory than physically available by utilizing disk storage as an extension of RAM (virtual memory).
  * Virtual addresses are mapped to physical addresses through page tables managed by the operating system.([Wikipedia][4])

* **Example**: When a program accesses a large dataset that doesn't fit entirely in RAM, the operating system uses virtual addresses to manage the data, swapping parts of it between RAM and disk as needed.

### üîÑ Address Translation Process

The translation from logical (or virtual) addresses to physical addresses is managed by the Memory Management Unit (MMU) using structures like page tables. This process ensures that each program operates within its own memory space, providing isolation and security.

| Virtual Address  | OS/MMU       | Programs        | Physical      | User-level   | ([Arm Developer][5], [GeeksforGeeks][2], [Stack Overflow][6], [Wikipedia][7], [Shiksha][8]) |
