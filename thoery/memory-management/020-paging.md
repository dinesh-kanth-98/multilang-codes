Paging is a memory management technique used by operating systems to efficiently allocate and manage memory for processes. It allows the physical memory (RAM) to be used more flexibly and enables processes to utilize more memory than is physically available by leveraging secondary storage.

### ðŸ§© How Paging Works

* **Division into Pages and Frames**: Both the logical (virtual) memory and physical memory are divided into fixed-size blocks.

  * **Pages**: Fixed-size blocks of logical memory.
  * **Frames**: Fixed-size blocks of physical memory.

* **Page Table**: The operating system maintains a page table for each process, which maps logical pages to physical frames. This mapping allows the system to translate logical addresses to physical addresses.

* **Non-Contiguous Allocation**: Paging eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory, thereby reducing issues like external fragmentation.([Lenovo][1])

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts

* **Virtual Memory**: Paging facilitates virtual memory, allowing processes to use more memory than physically available by swapping pages in and out of secondary storage (e.g., hard drives).

* **Page Faults**: When a process tries to access a page not currently in physical memory, a page fault occurs. The operating system then loads the required page from secondary storage into RAM.

* **Page Replacement Algorithms**: When physical memory is full, the OS uses algorithms like Least Recently Used (LRU) to decide which pages to swap out.

### âœ… Advantages of Paging

* **Efficient Memory Utilization**: By allowing non-contiguous memory allocation, paging makes better use of available memory.([Wikipedia][2])

* **Isolation and Protection**: Each process operates in its own address space, enhancing security and stability.

* **Simplified Memory Management**: Fixed-size pages and frames simplify the process of memory allocation and deallocation.([Stack Overflow][3])

Paging is fundamental to modern operating systems, enabling efficient and secure memory management, and allowing systems to run large applications smoothly even with limited physical memory.
