Yes, Linux supports virtual memory. Virtual memory is a fundamental feature of modern operating systems, including Linux, that allows the system to use disk storage as an extension of RAM, enabling efficient memory management and multitasking.([Server Fault][1])

### üìê Virtual Memory Size Limits in Linux

The size of virtual memory available to processes in Linux depends on the system architecture and kernel configuration:

* **32-bit Linux Systems**: Typically, a 32-bit Linux system provides up to 4 GB of virtual address space per process. However, due to kernel and user space division, approximately 3 GB is available for user processes, with the remaining 1 GB reserved for the kernel.&#x20;

* **64-bit Linux Systems**: A 64-bit Linux system significantly increases the virtual address space. By default, it allows up to 128 TiB (tebibytes) of virtual address space per process and can address approximately 64 TiB of physical memory, subject to processor and system limitations. ([Wikipedia][2])

* **With 5-Level Paging**: Modern processors and Linux kernels supporting 5-level paging can extend the virtual address space further, allowing up to 128 PiB (pebibytes) of virtual memory per process. ([Wikipedia][3])

### üõ†Ô∏è Managing Virtual Memory in Linux

Linux provides tools to view and manage virtual memory usage:

* **Viewing Limits**: You can check the current virtual memory limits using the `ulimit` command:([Unix & Linux Stack Exchange][4])

```bash
  ulimit -a
```

This will display various resource limits, including virtual memory.([Wikipedia][5])

* **Setting Limits**: To set a virtual memory limit for a session (in kilobytes), use:

```bash
  ulimit -v [limit_in_kb]
```

For example, to limit virtual memory to 1 GB:

```bash
  ulimit -v 1048576
```

Note that this limit applies to the shell session and any processes started from it. ([Unix & Linux Stack Exchange][4])

### üß† Conclusion

Linux fully supports virtual memory, providing each process with a large virtual address space. The actual limits depend on the system's architecture and kernel configuration, with 64-bit systems offering significantly larger virtual memory spaces than 32-bit systems. Tools like `ulimit` allow users to view and control virtual memory usage as needed.([Unix & Linux Stack Exchange][4])
