Memory fragmentation refers to the inefficient utilization of memory, where available memory is broken into small, non-contiguous blocks, making it challenging to allocate large contiguous memory blocks to programs. This fragmentation can degrade system performance and is primarily categorized into two types: internal and external fragmentation.([GeeksforGeeks][1])

### üß© Types of Memory Fragmentation

#### 1. Internal Fragmentation

* **Definition**: Occurs when allocated memory blocks have unused space due to fixed-size allocation units.([GeeksforGeeks][1])

* **Cause**: When a process requests memory, the system allocates it in fixed-sized blocks (e.g., pages). If the requested memory is less than the block size, the remaining space within the block remains unused.

* **Example**: If a system uses 4KB pages and a process requests 6KB of memory, it will be allocated two pages totaling 8KB, leading to 2KB of unused space.

#### 2. External Fragmentation

* **Definition**: Occurs when free memory is divided into small, non-contiguous blocks scattered throughout, preventing the allocation of large contiguous memory blocks even if the total free memory is sufficient.([GeeksforGeeks][1])

* **Cause**: As processes are loaded and removed from memory, they leave behind small free memory blocks. Over time, these scattered free blocks make it difficult to allocate large contiguous memory segments.

* **Example**: A system has 3 blocks of free memory: 2KB, 3KB, and 5KB. A process requests 6KB of contiguous memory, but despite having a total of 10KB free, the request cannot be fulfilled due to the non-contiguous nature of free memory.([Wikipedia][2])

### üß† Impact of Paging on Fragmentation

Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory, thereby addressing external fragmentation. However, it introduces internal fragmentation.

#### ‚úÖ Paging Helps Reduce External Fragmentation

* **Mechanism**: Paging divides both physical and logical memory into fixed-sized blocks called frames and pages, respectively.

* **Benefit**: Since any page can be placed into any frame, there's no need for contiguous memory allocation, effectively eliminating external fragmentation.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Paging Introduces Internal Fragmentation

* **Mechanism**: If a process's memory requirement doesn't exactly match the page size, the last page may not be fully utilized, leading to wasted space within that page.([Unix & Linux Stack Exchange][3])

* **Example**: A process requires 10KB of memory, and the system uses 4KB pages. The process will be allocated 3 pages (12KB), resulting in 2KB of unused space in the last page.

### üîÑ Summary

| Fragmentation Type | Cause                                                                              | Occurs In          | Paging Impact        |                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Internal           | Fixed-size allocation units leading to unused space within allocated memory blocks | Paging systems     | Introduced           |                                                                      |
| External           | Non-contiguous free memory blocks preventing allocation of large contiguous memory | Non-paging systems | Eliminated by paging | ([Wikipedia][4], [GeeksforGeeks][1], [Wikipedia][2], [Wikipedia][5]) |

In conclusion, while paging effectively eliminates external fragmentation by allowing non-contiguous memory allocation, it introduces internal fragmentation due to fixed-size pages. Understanding and managing these fragmentation types is crucial for optimizing memory utilization and system performance.([Computer Science Stack Exchange][6])
