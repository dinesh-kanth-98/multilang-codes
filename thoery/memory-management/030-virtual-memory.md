Virtual memory is a memory management technique that enables a computer to compensate for shortages of physical memory by temporarily transferring data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage. This process allows systems to run larger applications or multiple applications simultaneously, even if the physical RAM is limited.

### ðŸ§  How Virtual Memory Works

When a program is executed, it operates within a virtual address space. The operating system, with the help of the Memory Management Unit (MMU), maps these virtual addresses to physical addresses in RAM. If the required data is not present in RAM, the system retrieves it from the disk storage, a process known as paging. This mechanism provides the illusion of a large, continuous block of memory to applications, even if the physical memory is fragmented or limited.([GeeksforGeeks][1])

### ðŸ”„ Key Components

* **Page Table**: Maintains the mapping between virtual addresses and physical addresses.

* **Paging**: Transfers data between RAM and disk storage to manage memory usage efficiently.

* **Swap Space**: A designated area on the disk used to store data that cannot be held in RAM.

### âœ… Advantages of Virtual Memory

* **Efficient Memory Utilization**: Allows for better use of physical memory by loading only necessary parts of programs into RAM.

* **Isolation and Security**: Each process operates in its own virtual address space, preventing interference between processes.

* **Simplified Programming**: Programmers can write code without worrying about the physical memory limitations.([Wikipedia][2])

In summary, virtual memory enhances the efficiency and flexibility of memory usage in computer systems, enabling the execution of large or multiple applications concurrently, regardless of the physical memory constraints.
